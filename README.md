# Duplicate problem recognizer
This project is an end-to-end web-based work product primarily designed to determine whether two given problems are duplicated. The output will be displayed regardless of whether the given problem set is repeated or not.
## Motivation
Considering that some companies wish to retain text (such as discussion forums and query threads) for ease of management and subsequent user queries. We design a Duplicate problem recognizer to help filter out duplicate problems.

The Duplicate problem recorder provides a concise and easy-to-use web page. Users can input questions to determine if the problem is repeated. For the future, we will try to add additional features, which may include intention classification, emotion analysis, and automatic summarization.
## Report issues
Report bugs or feature requests using the [Duplicate problem recognizer issue tracker](https://github.com/shengjie94/AIM5011-Group4/issues).
At the same time, we also have a reporting function on the webpage. If there is a problem during use, click the 'Flag' button to mark it.
